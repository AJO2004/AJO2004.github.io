**Binary**

In this lesson we redid our learning on binary and highlighted again what it was and how it worked. We then went over hexadecimal and we then learnt how to do translations from denary and binary to Hexadecimal and the other way and so on and so forth. We spent the rest of the lesson doing this and suchlike conversions.
