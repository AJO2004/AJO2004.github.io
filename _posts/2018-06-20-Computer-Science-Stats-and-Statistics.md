**Sums and Statistics **

In this lesson of Computer Science we did some interesting things. In this lesson we looked at and made notes on different coding chunks and how many numbers in each and we also looked at different values for memory storage starting with bites and then ending up with massive values like petabytes and exabytes. We also went over how to times and divide binary numbers which you do by adding and taking off zeroes on the end.
