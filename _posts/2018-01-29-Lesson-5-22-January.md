**Lesson 5**

In our fifth IT lesson we carried on developing our virtual shops. We stated to try and make them a bit more interface user friendly by having different tabs for each different section in the google sheets. This meant that the shop assistant could just open it and just type in where they need to without any clutter and doesn't reallly need to know much like the discount codes and it allows the code to be sorted better and to be much more organised which creates a better virtual shop.
