**Lesson 12**

In this lesson of IT we again started a new repl.it python 3 page. It this lesson we created a prime number checker to check all the outcome to find if a number was prime. At the start of the lesson we talked about the uses of prime numbers in encryption and how valuable they were as information. We then delved into the logistics and coding of prime number checkers and then we went off and started to create our code. The code I used had a variable named S which started off as two and each time it wasn't equal to the number entered and the number entered was not divisible by it, it printed checking and added 1 to itself. If it was equal to itself then it would print prime as it had successfully checked all the other options and if it had been divisible by any other number then it would have printed Not Prime. I used a While True loop to make the code repeat itself and breaks in the code when the code reached a conclusion to finish.
