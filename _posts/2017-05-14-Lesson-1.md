**Lesson 1 (New Term)   24/4/17**

In our first IT lesson of the term we started to code on a website called codecademy, on the website there is many exercises to do with coding for you to complete on a coding program called python. The website gives you a tutorial on what to do to complete the code and then you work out may more exercises yourself. I learnt about different symbols that you use and that ** is the same as squaring a number in code.
