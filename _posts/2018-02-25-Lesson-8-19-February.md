**Lesson 8**

In this lesson of IT we looked at ascii and what it was. Basically ascii stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange and it gives each letter/character/input a Code that can be in many different forms Such as Binary in Decimal or eight-bit versions. This is a standard code for encryption and transport of messages. We will probably try to encrypt our info using this code.
