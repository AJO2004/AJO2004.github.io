**Lesson 3**

Happy New Year!!

In our third lesson of IT we revisited our blog site, which we post these blogs on. We made sure that everything was working fine and then we looked at the internal code of our blogs and changed the designs a bit. Then we were taught how to embed links into our blog and our teacher showed us his blog in-which was one of the videos he used to find out how to embed something. You had to go onto YouTube and select on a video publish to web. Then you had to get the link and embed it in your blog. Here I will try to embed the first version of my blog after two lessons of working on it.
