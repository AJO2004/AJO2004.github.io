**Lesson 2  8/5/17**

In the second lesson we had of IT we carried on with codecademy a site on which you can learn to code through various different exercises. We carried on from where we left off and worked through it for the lesson. I learnt about Booleans and other operators and how to make something come out True. (Booleans have capitals) One way to do it is 'not False' and another is 10 >= 9.99999999.
