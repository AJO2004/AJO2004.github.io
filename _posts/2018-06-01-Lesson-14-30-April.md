**Lesson 14**

In this IT lesson we started work on our quizzes. We first made some base code with different coding patterns we redid input questions and then we were tasked to start making the code. We then made the code with if and elif using Lower.a/b/c/d to make sure that it registered I also made a while true loop so they couldn't respond with the wrong answer because we had to get the information for the quiz, After this we then copied and pasted the base code 7 times and then we were asked to fill it in for Homework.
