**Lesson 15**

In this lesson of It having missed out a week due to a bank holiday my class and myself were fairly out of practice with computing even though we had filled out the last homework document (some of us). When we got into the lesson we were told to open up a new repl and to come to the front. When we did that our teacher started talking about using Def in our code so that you didn't have to copy and paste it out 7 times but you could just have a function and play it 8 times substituting in each time the different questions and words.
