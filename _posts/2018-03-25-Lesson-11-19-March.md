**Lesson 11**

In this IT lesson we started another python with turtle script and in this one we were trying to make a 3D shape which was a T. We revisited some functions of python with turtle and actually managed to get most of the way and we got the turtle to draw two T's one of which was offset slightly over the other one which sort of made a 3D shape which we then connected up to form a fairly well made T in 3D.
