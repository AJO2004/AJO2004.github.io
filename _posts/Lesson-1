**Lesson 1**

In this lesson we started to learn about spreadsheets and what they can be used for in the real world. We started our own spreadsheet on excel and we started to input some commands into the boxes to form a spreadsheet for a small business which was selling various items such as gloves, hats and shoes. We used a format for you to be able to pick an item and then put the frequency and it would calculate the total price of all the items for you. We did this using a 'vlookup' command which looked for an item in a specific location you inputted in the command as well.
