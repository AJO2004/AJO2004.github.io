**Lesson 10**

In this lesson of IT we switched from python with turtle to python 3. We started to code the basics of ai- being able to respond to answers in different ways. We started to utilise a feature in which you can permanently trap someone in a loop so that if you needed the information later on they had to give it to you to move on. We did this by typing While True: at the start and when they have given a correct answer typing break indented in to the if or elif so they have to answer. We also redid  a quick refresher course on Ifs elifs and else's.
