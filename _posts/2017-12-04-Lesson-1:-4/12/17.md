**Lesson 2**

In this lesson we carried on with our learning of spreadsheets. Today we learnt how to provide discounts easily on our products. You had to set a discount and how many items you need to buy to get it then use a greater than or equal to sign to determine whether or not they get the discount when they are buying their items.
