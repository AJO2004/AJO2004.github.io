  <tr>
    <td>We read the manuals for them and coded some simple things like making hello world repeat itself. The manuals were quite good learning tools.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One thing that may have limited my learning is that we were just sent to explore ourselves. It would of been nice to be told some helpful pages in the manual. I might need to work on typing faster to write more code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I'll change next time by making sure that my teammate also gets as much time coding as me.
I will improve my learning by exploring much more useful pages in the manual instead of just copying some code.</td>
