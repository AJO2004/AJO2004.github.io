**Holiday Codecademy**

**Thursday 18** 

I did 30 mins of codecademy and completed two exercises about def(parameters) which I struggled on but got through eventually.

**Saturday 3** 

I did an hour of codecademy on this day due to me being busy on the other days of the week and I completed 12 exercises on it. I learnt more about def and also I learnt how to import functions and what abs and type do. Then I moved on to planning for a trip using code.
