**Tests and Sheets**

In this lesson of computer science we took a change from the trend of coding practice on Thursdays as we did something different, we looked at spreadsheets! First of all we looked at different ways to display a picture of two colours, black and white in a computer. We were looking at the ways of compressing to generate smaller usages of bits and storage. Then we went on Google Sheets. We were tasked to draw a picture by colouring the squares then labelling them and sending the code via gmail to a friend who would then try and decrypt it onto a grid of their own using the ones and zeros to represent black and white, respectively.  We achieved this using conditional formatting which can detect if there is a one or a zero and colour the square that way. We then went back to the front and our teacher showed us an exam question. It was to compress this data as much as possible it was a 4 marker and had about 6 lines set out for it. The answer was simple: 6 0, 7 1, 4 0, 5 1, this was so simple that we were all absolutely astonished to find it that simple, this was a really good learning experience where I learned a lot about different areas of Computer Science.
