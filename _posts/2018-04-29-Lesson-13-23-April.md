**Lesson 13**

In this IT lesson we looked at making quizzes. First we went on some buzzfeed quizzes and then we discussed what we had done and then we learnt how different quizzes find their answers. Then we went back to our computers and started to write the script for the quiz that we would make. I did mine on which Star Wars droid are you and for the marking system I am going to use a points system with different groupings.
