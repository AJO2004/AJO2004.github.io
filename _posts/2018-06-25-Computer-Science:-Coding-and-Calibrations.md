**Coding and Calibrations**

In this lesson of computer science we were introduced to a method of revising and practicing our code making skills. We were shown a webpage with many different websites on it which we could use to learn and redo, some of them were codingame, check.io and codecombat we then went on a few of these in the lesson I went through some exercises and they really helped me relearn coding and the basics of it after a long break in the form of half term and trips from it.
