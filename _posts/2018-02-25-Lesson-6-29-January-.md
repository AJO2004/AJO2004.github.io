**Lesson 6**

In this lesson we carried on from what we did in the previous lesson which was improving our virtual shops to make the user interface easy to use and learn and to make it as a whole more Efficient and to calculate all our expenses, our staff and just generally to expand our stock range and products. We looked a bit at pricing of products in the real world and profit margins we also started to incorporate tax/VAT into our graph and products.
