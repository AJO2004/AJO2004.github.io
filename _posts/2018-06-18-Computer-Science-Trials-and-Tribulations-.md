**Trials and Tribulations **

At the start of this IT lesson we had a test. A test on binary and conversion to and from it into hex and decimal. I answered all of the questions right apart from one where I made a silly mistake. One of the questions had no marks assigned to it and so my teacher turned this mistake into a learning opportunity, he changed the marks on that question to 25000 and everyone was confused, then he explained he how did this to teach us that these sort of tests don't really matter in life and how there are only a few that do truly matter. We then spent the rest of the lesson watching a TED talk about cheating and what factors affect it. Our teacher then applied that to video games which are 'freeâ€™ but really make you spend money and the techniques they use to make you spend.
