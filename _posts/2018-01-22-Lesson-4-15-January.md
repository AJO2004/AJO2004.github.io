**Lesson 4**

In this lesson we revisited our sheets again and we looked at how some parts worked as we revisited them after we made them and we made sure they worked and that you could use them effectively to work. I also learnt how to change the size of the embedded video or sheets on my blog and I will show this here

This might not be working but I'm trying to get it to work.
